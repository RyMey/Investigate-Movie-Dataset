2. https://github.com/RyMey/Investigate-Movie-Dataset/blob/master/investigate-a-dataset-movie.ipynb to see the full code in <b> ipython version </b>.

I recommended to open the <b> html version </b> or open it in your personal jupyter notebook because I don't know some how the tables or markdowns are not rendered perfectly in github ipython preview.
